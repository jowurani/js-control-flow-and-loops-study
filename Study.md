    }
    ```

    **Answer:**

    ```

1. Will this loop ever stop? And is it a good idea?

    ** Example:**

    ```js
    while(true) {
      console.log("It goes on and on...");
    }
    ```

    **Answer:**

    ```
    The  while(true) loop above will never stop it's an infinite loop, which is not a good idea, because most if not all programs are wanted to stop at some point.
